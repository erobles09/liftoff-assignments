## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will allow you to track and manage inventory. User's may find it helpful that the app allows you to enter what inventory you used on specific date or event. You may also enter if any of the inventory was lost, damaged, or is no longer in inventory. This idea came from my dad's hobby of renting out his audio equipment to bands and halls. I noticed that when stuff got damaged or lost, we'd always blame it on the other person. He has so much stuff that I feel as if he himself doesn't know how much inventory he has or uses. With this app I hope it helps him organize and manage his hobby better.
### Features
Features include:
-Adding/Removing items to inventory(User will be able to add new items and remove old items from inventory).
-Search items in inventory(User will be able to search to see if inventory is still available).

I will be using:

### What I'll Have to Learn
